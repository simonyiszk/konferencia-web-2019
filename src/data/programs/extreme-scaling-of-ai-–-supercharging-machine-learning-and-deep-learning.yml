  In this presentation we will demonstrate the extreme scaling capabilities
  within a single DGX-2 node with 2 Petaflop/s (mixed-precision Tensor Core
  operations). Following that we highlight the DL and ML ecosystem supporting
  DGX. We conclude with architectural blueprints for massive multi-node scaling
  to further expand overall performance.
